            <title><![CDATA[About Me]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About Me</h1><p>My name is Ali and I'm proud to be born and raised here in the Pacific Northwest. So much of my inspiration is drawn from the diverse terrain of Washington State, I couldn't imagine living anywhere else. I'm obsessed with design, which is super vague I know, but I honestly can't think of any 'one' thing I'm passionate about designing. I'm excited by UI/UX mobile design, branding, print collateral such as posters, flyers, business cards. Brilliant packaging makes my heart skip a beat. I'm constantly thinking of new ways to put a spin on what it is I'm designing so I tend to keep up with the current trends, so as you can imagine I spend a LOT of time behind a screen and I couldn't feel more at home! (In other words, I'm screwed if I were ever in an apocalypse! And btw, this does not interfere with my love for post-apocalyptic games and TV shows...)</p></article>]]></description>
